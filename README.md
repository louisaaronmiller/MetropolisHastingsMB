# Todo
1. implement a stable calculation for C, by reading on.

# Graphing Todo
1. varying Lambda for 3 -> <v> assuming C=1, calculating C, <v> with the calculation of C
2. varying lambda for initial histogram for -> small range `[0.3,5]`, and `[0.5,100000]`
3. A billion steps histogram, using average velocity as the initial velocity.
